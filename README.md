An alternative to the fantastic [Bugle Podcast Archive](http://www.gamesplusone.com/thebugle/).

Built with Svelte, using CSS Grid for layout. Responsive.
Grabs audio files from a mirror hosted on Digital Ocean.

Baby's First Svelte Project.

Worse than a static HTML page in that it does nothing that a
static HTML page wouldn't, but uses JavaScript to do so. Plan
is to add an audio player, playback state tracking, and various
other nice things that you'd get with a podcast player.

(Why not just use a podcast player? None of them do well with
this sort of archival material that is no longer hosted properly
as a podcast. And I wanted a project!)
